# 3D Room Portfolio using Three.js
This is my personal and **actual** portfolio made with Three.js and Blender.

The concept is to allow user to interact with most of the elements by clicking or hovering.
## Librairies :
- Three.js (obviously)
- Thee.interactive

## Usage :
This repository include every necessary files, so you just have to clone.

**[WARNING]** Three.js wants us to use HTML `importmap` to work without embeded server (eg. vite). This is curently **not well suported**

**/!\ LIBRAIRIES FILE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED SO THE IMPORT WORK WITHOUT IMPORTMAP /!\\**

=> you **MUST** use the given librairies **OR** manually edit all import used (check that all import used are in absolute path and don't forget to also edit imported file)
